<Layout title="Content Container" description="The content container positions the main content on the page depending on the viewport size.">

## Usage Guidance

The positioning is based on `breakpoints` from [design tokens](/foundation/design-tokens):

- content is always centered, even if there is side navigation
- for all viewport sizes, maximum content width is `1200px`
- for phones, and small tablets (viewport size below `medium` breakpoint), padding around content of `medium` size is used
- for desktop, and large tablets (for viewport size above `medium` breakpoint), padding is increased to `xlarge` size

You may check a [little demo](https://waffles-grid.surge.sh/) which should help to understand relationship between `ContentContainer`, `SideNavigation`, and grid. If you're curious about implementation details there is also [repository](https://github.com/datacamp-engineering/waffles-demo-grid) with a demo's source code.
