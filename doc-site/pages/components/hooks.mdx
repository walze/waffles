## useId

A lot of accessibility-related features rely heavily on element IDs. Manually providing such IDs is both cumbersome and error-prone. To aid with that the hook autogenerates **random ID** with a prefix.

<Example title="Basic Usage" path="hooks/use-id-basic-usage">
  <UseIdBasicUsage />
</Example>

## useMediaQuery

A hook to conditionally render component based on the viewport size. Following mobile-first approach, consider base return without conditional rendering to be the mobile one. Useful when wildly different components must be rendered depending on device screen size.

It determines, if there is a media query match for current viewport for each breakpoint from [design tokens](/foundation/design-tokens): `isAboveSmall`, `isAboveMedium`, `isAboveLarge`.

<Example title="Basic Usage" path="hooks/use-media-query-basic-usage">
  <UseMediaQueryBasicUsage />
</Example>

## useAnimateTransition

Handlings animations of components that are conditionally appearing and disappearing, like dialogs, overlays, and dropdowns, could be quite tricky because normally there is no time for an exit animation to finish when the component unmounts.

This hook delays component unmount by the specified time, which allows complex CSS animations to finish. It doesn't animate styles by itself, therefore custom CSS keyframe animations must be provided explicitly.

<Example title="Basic Usage" path="hooks/use-animate-transition-basic-usage">
  <UseAnimateTransitionBasicUsage />
</Example>

## useIsomorphicLayoutEffect

Occasionally there is a need to use `useLayoutEffect` React hook to ensure there is not a render flash for certain operations. This hook bypasses React warning when trying to use `useLayoutEffect` on the server.

## useCallbackRef

Persists any function and prevents it from being invalidated between renders. Also keeps it up to date if it changes.

## useMergeRefs

Merge two React refs into single one in a stable way.

## Imports

You can import following components or utilities from this module:

<Imports module={HooksExports} path="@datacamp/waffles/hooks" />
