Therefore it's important to provide support for assistive technologies, such as screen readers, which are essential to people with vision or motor impairments.">

## Testing Accessibility

Unfortunately, using accessible Waffles components doesn't automatically mean, that you have an entirely accessible application. Consider the amount of code in your app that doesn't come from Waffles&mdash;it's a lot, isn't it? You need to audit your application to make sure every visitor can successfully use it.

### Automated Testing

It’s best to start accessibility testing with automated tools such as [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe) or [lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse). Even better if such checks are part of CI/CD pipeline. They are good at finding:

- insufficient text to background contrast ratios
- empty links and buttons
- missing `alt` image tags
- missing or incorrect usage of headings

Unfortunately, they discover only about 30-50% of accessibility issues and fail miserably when it comes to all kinds of behavioral or not-so-obvious problems. Therefore it’s recommended to run a set of manual tests as well.

### Manual Testing Practical Guide

At this point probably a lot of accessibility issues got discovered and addressed during the prototyping phase and by using automated tests. In most cases, to be fully compliant with [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21) and to meet the highest accessibility standards a few additional manual tests are required:

#### Zoom In

- use `Cmd + Plus` to zoom in to at least 150% (ideally 200%), and `Cmd + 0` to reset magnification to 100%

#### Navigate with Keyboard

- all interactive elements on the web page should have a distinguishable focus style
- `Tab` key is used to focus interactive elements, and `Shift + Tab` to focus the previous element
- `Up/Down Arrow` key is used to move through items in dropdown
- use `Enter` or `Space` to interact

#### Use Screen Reader

- Mac OS X has a built-in screen reader VoiceOver&mdash;to activate it press `Cmd + F5`
- the most often used combination by people with disabilities is `Ctrl + Opt + Cmd + H` (jump between headings)
- to move between elements use `Tab` or `Ctrl + Opt + Left/Right Arrow`
- to interact with element use `Enter` or `Ctrl + Opt + Space`

It's best to use Chrome web browsers for accessibility testing because, unfortunately, other browsers often lack even basic accessibility features, or they are quite tricky to enable.
