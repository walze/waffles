## For Engineers

Waffles aims to bring order and consistency to all DataCamp products. Waffles comes with React web component library which is available on npm as [@datacamp/waffles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@datacamp/waffles). It ships with [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support out of the box. No additional type definitions must be installed. For styling it uses [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) component-oriented CSS-in-JS solution.

### Installation

Run the following command to install the component library:

```bash
# with yarn
yarn add @datacamp/waffles

# with npm
npm install @datacamp/waffles
```

Install peer dependencies, if you haven't already:

```bash
# with yarn
yarn add react react-dom @emotion/react

# with npm
npm install react react-dom @emotion/react
```

### Usage

Simply import the appropriate component directly in your React project:

```js
import { Button } from '@datacamp/waffles/button';
```
